# Suspicious Phishing Email

## Symptoms
The user reports receiving an email requesting account verification.
The message contains a link and uses an urgent tone, warning that the account will be blocked.

## Possible Causes
-Mass phishing campaigns targeting corporate users
-Lack of security awareness
-Insufficient or misconfigured email filtering

## Diagnosis
1. Instruct the user not to interact with the email.
2. Review the sender’s address and email domain.
3. Analyze the link without clicking it (hover inspection).
4. Check for grammatical errors or generic messaging.
5. Verify whether the legitimate company would request such information via email.

Example Findings:
- The sender appears legitimate, but the domain does not match the official one.
- The link redirects to an external URL unrelated to the company.

## Solution
- Instruct the user to delete the email.
- Report the message to the IT or Security team.
- Block the sender domain if applicable.

## Case: User Clicked the Link
- If the user interacted with the link:
  - Force an immediate password reset.
  - Review recent login activity.
  - Recommend an urgent malware/antivirus scan of the device.
   

## Resolution Example:
- The email was deleted without user interaction.
- The incident was reported to the IT team to prevent similar cases.
- No unauthorized access was detected.

## Prevention
- Provide regular security awareness training.
- Enforce strong, unique passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Encourage users to verify messages before interacting with suspicious emails.
