# High CPU Usage on User Device

## Symptoms
The user reports that the device is running slowly.
Applications take longer than usual to respond, and the cooling fan remains constantly active.

## Possibles causes
- Background processes consuming excessive CPU resources.
- Applications configured to start automatically at system boot.
- Malware or potentially unwanted software.
- Insufficient system resources for the current workload.

## Diagnosis
1. Open the Task Manager.
2. Identify and sort processes by CPU usage.
3. Review startup applications.
4. Run a basic security scan to identify abnormal or suspicious processes.
5. Check for pending operating system updates.

## Examples:

- A web browser with multiple open tabs is consuming more than 70% of the CPU.
- An unknown application is configured to start automatically with the system.

## Resolution Example:
- Browser tabs were closed, reducing CPU usage to 20%.
- An unnecessary startup application was disabled.
- The device returned to normal performance.

## Solution
- Terminate unnecessary applications.
- Disable non-essential startup programs.
- Uninstall unnecessary or unauthorized software.
- Apply pending system updates.

## Prevention
- Keep the operating system up to date. 
- Regulary review startup applications.
